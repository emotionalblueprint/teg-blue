#TEGâ€‘Blueâ„¢ â€” Structural Backbone

A full system for emotional clarity and repair.  
**Frameworks explain the *why*. Tools reveal the *how*. Infrastructure ensures it can scale.**

---

## 1. Core Emotional Frameworks (1â€“11)

These explain the *emotional logic* behind human behaviorâ€”how emotions shift across the four modes, and how wounds shape identity, power, and systems.

1. **The Emotional Gradient Framework**  
   Protectâ€“Defense Mode vs. Connectâ€“Belonging Mode.  
   Recalibrates the internal compass that shapes how we interpret emotion, safety, and connection.

2. **The Ego Persona Construct Framework**  
   How we build false identities to survive emotional harmâ€”and lose access to our authentic self.

3. **Our Three Inner Layers Framework**  
   Raw Emotion â†’ Protection â†’ Performed Identity.  
   A map for understanding whatâ€™s really driving your behavior.

4. **Breaking The False Models of Our Society Framework**  
   Why systems reward disconnection and controlâ€”and how we can dismantle the emotional myths underneath.

5. **The Capital Filter Framework**  
   How power structures decide whose emotions matterâ€”and whose are erased.

6. **The Emotional Architecture of Bias Framework**  
   Bias as a nervous system response, not ignoranceâ€”born from emotional overwhelm and survival patterns.

7. **How Tyrants Are Made: From Emotional Defense to Tyranny Framework**  
   What happens when unhealed trauma meets unchecked power.

8. **Neurodivergence & Emotional Evolution Framework**  
   Different brains as emotional adaptationsâ€”not flaws, but signals of evolution.

9. **Healing Our Inner Child & Rebuilding Ourselves Framework**  
   Reconnecting with our younger self to dissolve the need for protective personas.

10. **Rebuilding Generational Bridges Framework**  
    Healing inherited trauma and restoring emotional connection across family lines.

11. **The Emotional Logic Behind Human Paradoxes Framework**  
    Explaining why people contradict themselvesâ€”through emotional pattern logic, not randomness.

â†’ These frameworks define the *four emotional modes*:  
**Connectâ€“Belonging**, **Protectâ€“Defense**, **Manipulation**, and **Tyranny**  
â€¦and show how humans shift between them.

## 2. Emotional Tools & Gradient Scales

While frameworks explain the system, these tools let you *see it in real life*.  
They help you recognize patterns, name harm, and shift emotional states with precision.

Each tool is visual, trauma-aware, and built for clarity across personal and systemic use.

Key tools include:

- Emotional Gradient Scale  
- Hurt Gradient Scale  
- Weaponized Empathy Detection Tool  
- False Safety Map  
- Manipulation Gradient Scale  
- Repair Readiness Tool  
- Tyranny Early Warning System  
- â€¦and more

â†’ These tools live inside `/tools/` â€”each with its own `.md` file and visual spec.

---

## 3. Glyph Library (1.11)

A visual emotional languageâ€”showing how each feeling appears in the body, why it happens, and how itâ€™s misread.

- 8 glyphs for **Defense Mode**  
- 8 glyphs for **Belonging Mode**

â†’ Emotion made visible  
â†’ Designed for neurodivergent use, somatic recognition, and intuitive learning

## 4. Emotional Technology Infrastructure

These are the technical foundations that make TEGâ€‘Blue scalableâ€”across AI, research, education, and systems design.

- **TEGâ€‘Code**  
  A structured format for turning emotional logic into data.  
  From pattern recognition to manipulation detection.

- **EMLU Benchmark** *(Emotional Multitask Language Understanding)*  
  A trauma-informed benchmark for evaluating how AI interprets human emotion, harm, and repair.

â†’ These live inside `/teg-code-ai/` and include visual schemas and usage rules.

---

## 5. Licensing & Purpose Alignment

TEGâ€‘Blue is offered under a **purpose-aligned license**.  
Open to all for personal and non-commercial use.  
Commercial, clinical, or AI-integrated applications require explicit agreement.

---

## ðŸ’Œ 6. Personal Legacy

Includes personal files such as:

- `for-iona-ivet-aran.md` â€” a message for the children who inspired this system  
- Other legacy letters or notes, if needed

â†’ These live in `/legacy/`  
â†’ TEGâ€‘Blue is not just theory. Itâ€™s a survival map turned into a gift.
