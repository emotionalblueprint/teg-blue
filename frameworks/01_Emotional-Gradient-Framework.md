# 01 – The Emotional Gradient Framework

**This is the foundation of TEG‑Blue.**  
Everything else—tools, patterns, harm detection—builds from here.

---

##  Core Concept

Human behavior shifts depending on which *emotional mode* we’re operating from.

This framework maps emotion across four core modes:

1. **Connect–Belonging Mode**  
   Safety, curiosity, grounded presence

2. **Protect–Defense Mode**  
   Guarded, reactive, survival-focused

3. **Manipulation Mode**  
   Using emotion to control, distort, or avoid truth

4. **Tyranny Mode**  
   Deliberate harm, domination, cruelty as power

---

##  Why It Matters

Most emotional confusion comes from **not knowing which mode someone is in**—or what mode *we* are in.

This framework offers a clear, visual way to:

- Understand why emotional states change so quickly  
- Track how defense turns into control  
- Distinguish discomfort from real harm  
- Make sense of contradictions in behavior

---

##  What This Framework Enables

- Emotional pattern recognition  
- Harm detection tools  
- Gradient scales (e.g. Hurt Scale, Manipulation Scale)  
- AI emotional logic models  
- System design for emotional safety
