# 02 – The Ego Persona Construct Framework

**The masks we build to survive.**  
This framework explains how emotional harm shapes our identity—and how the roles we adopt to protect ourselves eventually become who we think we are.

---

##  Core Concept

When we’re hurt—especially early in life—we build *personas* to stay safe:

- The Good One  
- The Smart One  
- The Quiet One  
- The Helper  
- The Rebel  
- The Performer

These aren’t just personality quirks. They’re **emotional survival strategies**.

Over time, these masks harden into identity.

---

##  Why It Matters

If we don’t recognize our false personas, we confuse **defense** for **self**.

We make decisions, form relationships, and define our worth around roles that were created in pain.

This framework helps people:

- See the difference between their **true self** and **adapted self**  
- Understand why “just be yourself” is often impossible  
- Recognize when their decisions are being driven by fear, not truth  
- Begin to reconnect with the parts of themselves they had to hide

##  The Layers of Persona

1. **Wound** — The original emotional harm  
2. **Belief** — “I’m not safe unless…”  
3. **Adaptation** — Behavior that avoids re-injury  
4. **Persona** — Role adopted to feel acceptable or protected  
5. **Reinforcement** — External systems that reward the mask

- Identity deconstruction tools  
- Healing inner child work  
- Understanding emotional performance in relationships
